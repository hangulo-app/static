## What is Hangulo?

Hangulo is a truly interactive Hangul(Korean alphabet) reading tool that guides the reader block-by-block, syllable-by-sylablle, word-by-word-- you literally name it-- through reading in Hangul.

Users read aloud a highlighted block, ranging from vowel-consonant orders(ㄷ + ( ㅗ +ㅐ = ㅙ ) = 돼) to phrases, and move onto the next block upon correctly reading the previous.

The motivation for Hangulo comes not from the difficulty of reading Hangul(it's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE4eplsFSms'>really easy</a>), but from the difficulty of reading naturally, meaning reading words rather than syllables. The idea of the game is to help Hangul learners practice reading, syllable-by-sylablle, first; then, progressively, by words.

Currently, the user can read per-block, or multiple at a time. A future implementation will be a reward/point system that gives more points for reading consecutive blocks correctly, or reading multiple blocks in one utterance (i.e. reading the whole word if each block is a syllable).

I'd like to add more interactivity and incentive to the, at times, equally boring and overwhelming process of beginner-level reading in Korean. Many of us <i>technically</i> know how to read and pronounce letters. But, when we have to read aloud sentences and paragraphs, mild dyslexia seems to hit, and we read at a snail's pace.
